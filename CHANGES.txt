- $chg_term() -- allows  changing the  terminal currently  matched in the
  scanner prior to that matched terminal entering the parser.
  This is a fairly advanced  feature that can  be hazardous, nevertheless
  some languages really need it (C).

- $set_mode() -- allows setting the current  scanner mode using a special
  identifier from inside a pattern  action. This avoids the need of using
  prefixes (for  both the  <prefix>set_mode  function and  its M_<PREFIX>
  constants.

- Better error location management, in particular when the error does not
  have any input associated with it (eg. for instance, "unexpected end of
  input" on any of the sections, has no associated text and yet can occur
  frequently if, e.g. a brace is mismatched.)

- Scannerless generation fix; previously had trouble generating without a 
  scanner but this is a supported method.

- Minor cleanups in code and NOTICE file.
