- inireader example - reads .ini files using Carburetta in a scanner-only
  fashion. Demonstrates  how to build a  library-like  encapsulation of a
  carburetta  scanner/parser where  the user-code  retains control of the 
  flow.

- fix: <prefix>scan() header prototype was broken if no additional params
  were passed in.

- fix: if, for whatever  reason, the input has  no epilogue section, both
  the scanner and  grammar sections should still  complete their parsing.
  (I.e. know  they've reached the  end of their inputs.)  Previously, the
  last line / directive / production could be ignored.

- $chg_term() -- allows  changing the  terminal currently  matched in the
  scanner prior to that matched terminal entering the parser.
  This is a fairly advanced  feature that can  be hazardous, nevertheless
  some languages really need it (C).

- $set_mode() -- allows setting the current  scanner mode using a special
  identifier from inside a pattern  action. This avoids the need of using
  prefixes (for  both the  <prefix>set_mode  function and  its M_<PREFIX>
  constants.

- Better error location management, in particular when the error does not
  have any input associated with it (eg. for instance, "unexpected end of
  input" on any of the sections, has no associated text and yet can occur
  frequently if, e.g. a brace is mismatched.)

- Scannerless generation fix; previously had trouble generating without a 
  scanner but this is a supported method.

- Minor cleanups in code and NOTICE file.
